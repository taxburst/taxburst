# taxburst: sunburst charts for taxonomy, based on Krona

**WARNING: alpha mode software. Use at your own risk.**

This is an update of Krona, written with the following goals in mind:

* liberate tax displays from the tyranny of NCBI taxonomy IDs and taxdump;
* support dynamic generation of Krona-style plots;
* rewrite in modern Python;
* support ~nicer multi-stage generation of XHTML;
* probably other things;

The output HTML is based on https://github.com/marbl/Krona.

All bugs are mine until proven otherwise.
