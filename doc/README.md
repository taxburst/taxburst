# taxburst documentation

taxburst is a fork of the [Krona](https://github.com/marbl/Krona)
software, (see:
[Ondov, Bergman, and Philippy, 2011](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-385)). It
produces static HTML pages that provide an interactive display of a
metagenomic taxonomy.

This is still alpha mode software, to be used at your own risk.

Please file bug reports and feature requests on [the issue tracker](https://github.com/taxburst/taxburst/issues).

## Install

taxburst is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) under [pypi.org/project/taxburst](https://pypi.org/project/taxburst/).

To install it, run:

```
pip install taxburst
```

## Authors

The original Krona software was developed by Brian Ondov, Nicholas
Bergman, and Adam Philippy.

taxburst is developed by Titus Brown. The HTML format is largely unchanged,
but the parsing front-end and output mechanisms have been completely
rewritten in Python.
